## Hi, I'm Duncan 👋

I'm a full-stack software engineer based in Manchester, UK.

👨‍💻 [I also write on Substack on how to write scalable code, or make technical decisions that scale](https://duncanwilder.substack.com).

Check out some of the stuff I've been playing around with in my pinned repositories 👇

### Other work

I'm not ready to share the source code for these, but here's some other things I've tinkered with.

#### Saltplate

Saltplate is a recipe management website I built. Add your own recipes to it, add them to a planner + scale them for how many each needs to feed, then add them to a smart shopping list, designed to make the weekly shop easy.

#### Gooder News

<img width="200" height="201" src="./gooder-news.jpg" alt="Gooder News homepage">

Gooder News is an AI-powered news aggregator that uses the latest AI features to filter and group positive news stories from mainstream UK publishers.

It’s easy to get bogged down in all the negativity that exists on the Internet. But there’s also a lot of positive news out there—it’s just harder to find.

There are sites like [Positive News](https://www.positive.news) that focus on positive stories, but they often don’t discuss current events such as general elections or football.

That’s where Gooder News comes in. See the latest news, without the negativity.

#### Lamina

Lamina is a dependency inversion layer that sits on top of component testing libraries such as Enzyme or React Testing Library. It abstracts component-testing logic and libraries into a single API, avoiding tying your test code to a specific library.

When Enzyme fell out of favour in 2021, we had a big project to migrate to RTL. Who knows how long it'll last until it falls out of favour itself. By using an abstraction layer on top of your component tests, you can avoid the pain of switching between testing libraries without needing big re-writes every few years.
