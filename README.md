## Hi, I'm Duncan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer based in Manchester, UK.

Check out some of the stuff I've been playing around with in my pinned repositories ðŸ‘‡

### Other work

I'm not ready to share the source code for these, but here's some other things I've tinkered with.

#### Saltplate

Saltplate is a recipe management website I built. Add your own recipes to it, add them to a planner + scale them for how many each needs to feed, then add them to a smart shopping list, designed to make the weekly shop easy.

#### Gooder News

Gooder News is an AI-powered news aggregator that uses the latest AI features to filter and group positive news stories from mainstream UK publishers.

Itâ€™s easy to get bogged down in all the negativity that exists on the Internet. But thereâ€™s also a lot of positive news out thereâ€”itâ€™s just harder to find.

There are sites like [Positive News](https://www.positive.news) that focus on positive stories, but they often donâ€™t discuss current events such as general elections or football.

Thatâ€™s where Gooder News comes in. See the latest news, without the negativity.
